# Small Scale Workshops
This workshop was made using the [P2PU Course-in-a-box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/) template. We host our workshop materials through GitHub, a free and open-source software hosting platform. Here you'll find the backend of our workshop. 

> The goal of this workshop is to familiarize yourself with basic GIS-web concepts and know what resources are available to you at Northwestern. 

The Geospatial and Data Services Team at Northwestern University Libraries is dedicated to helping you with your geospatial analysis, visualization and data management needs.
