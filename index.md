### Goal of this workshop
> This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to bivariate choropleth mapping. It's a simple workshop that you should be able to replicate on your own afterwards.  

<br>

By the end of this workshop you will be able to: 

* Distinguish between univariate and bivariate 
* Type of GIS data including Living Atlas sources
* Knowledge of basic symbology functions
* Ability to make a bivariate choropleth map and layout
* Resources and support opportunities
