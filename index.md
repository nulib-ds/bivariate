### Goal of this workshop
> This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to bivariate choropleth mapping. It's a simple workshop that you should be able to replicate on your own afterwards.  

<br>

By the end of this workshop you will be able to: 

* Distinguish between univariate and bivariate 
* Type of GIS data including Living Atlas sources
* Knowledge of basic symbology functions
* Ability to make a bivariate choropleth map and layout
* Resources and support opportunities

## Considerations
• Normalize your data (!) 
• Use variables you suspect have a relationship (e.g., rainfall & diabetes vs. obesity & diabetes)
• Not statistically significant, only looking at highest vs. lowest values of overlaid variables
