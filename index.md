### Goal of this workshop
> This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to bivariate choropleth mapping. It's a simple workshop that you should be able to replicate on your own afterwards.  

<br>

### By the end of this workshop you will be able to: 

> * Distinguish between univariate and bivariate 
> <br>
> * Type of GIS data including Living Atlas sources
> <br>
> * Knowledge of basic symbology functions
> <br>
> * Ability to make a bivariate choropleth map and layout
> <br>
> * Resources and support opportunities

### Considerations
> • Normalize your data (!) 
> <br>
> • Use variables you suspect have a relationship (e.g., rainfall & diabetes vs. obesity & diabetes)
> <br>
> • Not statistically significant, only looking at highest vs. lowest values of overlaid variables
