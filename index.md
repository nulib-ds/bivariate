> * We'll be using ArcPro and ArcOnline for today's demo. You'll need to create an ArcGIS Online account [here.](https://northwestern.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) To download and install ArcPro, go [here](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/software/secure/index.html).

### **Goal of this workshop**
> This workshop is meant to serve as an introduction to bivariate choropleth mapping. It's a simple workshop that you should be able to replicate on your own afterwards.  

<br>

### **By the end of this workshop you will be able to:** 

> * Distinguish between univariate and bivariate 
> 
> * Type of GIS data including Living Atlas sources
> 
> * Knowledge of basic symbology functions
> 
> * Ability to make a bivariate choropleth map and layout
> 
> * Resources and support opportunities

### **Considerations**
> * Normalize your data (!) 
> 
> * Use variables you suspect have a relationship (e.g., rainfall & diabetes vs. obesity & diabetes)
> 
> * Not statistically significant, only looking at highest vs. lowest values of overlaid variables
